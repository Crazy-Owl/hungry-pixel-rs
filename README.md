# Hungry Pixel (Rust edition)

I once used LÃ–VE to implement a simple game where a player control a pixel, eats other pixels and grow. This is my second attempt: in order to get familiar with Rust, SDL2 and to develop my game architecture (described later) I decided to implement a simple game.

## Technologies used

I've decided to use Rust, along with `rust-sdl2`. I also use `image` and `ttf` features of `rust-sdl2`.

## Building the game

### Prerequisites

First of all, ensure that you have dev versions of `sdl2`, `sdl2-image` and `sdl2-ttf`. You should be able to obtain them either using your OS package manager or by downloading them from [SDL2 site](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and then following instructions in `INSTALL` file. If you're on Windows you should add directory with .dll files to your `PATH` to run the built game.

### Building the game

Next, clone the repository and run `cargo build --release` in it. You will need to move `target/release/hungry-pixel-rs` executable along with `resources` dir somewhere and then you'll be able to run it. As an alternative, you can use `cargo run` command to just run the dev build.

## Architectural overview

Game architecture is based on a notion of "States". A `State` is an entity that knows how to respond to `Messages` and how to `render` itself on screen. States are gathered into a stack of states that resides in the `Engine` entity. `Engine` also has a queue of `Messages`.

Inside the `Engine`, a loop is running:

1. First, the events from SDL are collected. Some of them are translated into `Messages` that are added to MessageQueue.
2. Then the rendering happens. All the states are analyzed, searching the first that returns `true` when `is_fullscreen` is called on it. Then they are rendered in the reverse order, from that state to the top of the stack.
3. Then, messages are propagated down the `States` stack. Every `State` in stack can either consume, transform or pass the message. Consuming happens when `process_message` fn returns `None`, and makes the `Engine` process next message right away. `State` can transform message by returning a `Some(Message)` variant of `Option<Message>` type from `process_message` fn, or pass it by returning the original message in `Some` variant. The message is then propagated to the next `State` in queue and passed to the `process_message` method of it.
4. When the message is either consumed or propagated all the way through the stack, it is processed by the `Engine` itself and next message is consumed.
